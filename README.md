# 🔐 Password Strength Checker and Security Analysis

This project evaluates the strength of various passwords and demonstrates common security testing techniques used in cybersecurity environments. It includes analysis, visual summaries, attack simulations, and security recommendations to help users understand and improve password safety.


## 🛠 Tools Used

- **cracklib-check** – Validates passwords against a basic dictionary of weak passwords.
- **grep + rockyou.txt** – Simulates dictionary attacks using the widely known `rockyou.txt` password list.
- **Python scripts** – Custom scripts used to calculate password entropy and structural strength.
- **hashcat** – Demonstrates how quickly different types of passwords can be cracked using hash-based brute-force attacks.


## 📁 Project Contents

- `Passwd_strength_checker.html` – A visually styled HTML report summarizing the full password analysis.
- **Password Examples** – A variety of password types categorized by complexity and structure.
- **Security Tables** – Organized data on:
  - Password strength scoring
  - Attack techniques
  - Security best practices
